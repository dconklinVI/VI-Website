== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I set a custom Lead Source? =

This feature uses `gf_hubspot_lead_source` is the filter.

Add the following to your theme's `functions.php` file. Modify as you see fit:

`
add_filter('gf_hubspot_lead_source', 'create_lead_source', 1, 3);

function create_lead_source($lead_source, $form_meta, $data) {
	// $lead_source - What was about to be used (normally Gravity Forms Form Title)
	// $form_meta - Gravity Forms form details
	// $data - The data to be passed to HubSpot via Lead API

	return $lead_source; // Return something else if you want to.
}
`

= Can I use HubSpot Custom Fields? =

When you are trying to map a custom field, you need to set either the "Admin Label" for the input (in the Advanced tab of each field in the  Gravity Forms form editor) or the Parameter Name (in Advanced tab, visible after checking "Allow field to be populated dynamically") to be the field name of the custom field as shown in HubSpot. For example, a Custom Field with a Field Label "Web Source" could have an Lead API Name of "WebSource" or "SfCampaignId" or "HS_WS_Forms" or something else entirely.

You can find your custom fields in the HubSpot Form Manager.
